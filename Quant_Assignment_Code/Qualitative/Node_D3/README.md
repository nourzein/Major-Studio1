My project focuses on the Islamic Art collect of the Met Museum. 
I was initially intrigued by the collection due to my cultural background, and then inspired by their article on the chronology of the Islamic World's empires and dynasties. 
I am interested in using a multi-line graph to show the amount of the artwork overtime by country, inclduing information of the type of artwork and era in which it comes from. 
The goal is to visualise information on the Islamic Art collection of the Met, and potentially cross reference it with important events in the countries during the aquisition.
