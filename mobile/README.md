This projects takes the interactive pieces and builds on it to make it more accesible to a wide range of devices.

The piece as is does a good job at conveying the rich information extracted from each paitning in the European department, however, it relies heavily on the width of the desktop and does not respond well to other screen sizes.

Therefore, I decied to focus on making it responsive.

I changed the initial exploratory-interactive visualization

To create a controlled storytelling experience with each chapter presented seperately with the findings and examples.
